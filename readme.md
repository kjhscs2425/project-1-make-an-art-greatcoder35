# Project Proposal

1. Roughly, what will your drawing look like
2d or 3d drawing using cubes as pixels

2. What are two variables you could use so that when you change each variable, the drawing changes?
a. the length of each side
b. scale factor

3. Where is there repetition in your drawing?
each cube

4. What are the main parts of your drawing? Are there clear sections or objects?
the cubes

5. How could you use a loop variable of a for loop? Is there somewhere in your drawing where something is repeated, but it's slightly different each time? Maybe the same object is repeated in different places, or maybe a similar object is repeated but with different sizes?

possibly i could use different sized cubes
